Learning exercise: Utf8 Parser
===


This project is not intended to be used in any environment. This was an exercise for me to learn more about Unicode encoding.


### Details

- Only tested against a valid utf-8 encoded binary
- Results are compared to Node's own utf-8 parser (Buffer#toString('utf-8'))
